## ‚ùì Problem Statement

For most people, planning a trip is often as stressful as it is exciting. The process involves juggling dozens of open browser tabs, manually comparing prices, and piecing together an itinerary in a separate document. The resulting plan is rigid and fragile; a single flight delay or a rainy day can throw the entire schedule into disarray, forcing stressful, on-the-spot decisions.

A fundamental disconnect exists between the static, manual planning process and the dynamic, unpredictable nature of travel itself. **Travelers lack a trusted assistant that can not only build a plan based on their unique tastes and budget but also adapt that plan intelligently when faced with real-world changes.**

  * **Real-time Itinerary Optimization:** Autonomously adjusts schedules in response to flight delays, adverse weather, or traffic, sending instant alerts and alternative suggestions.
  * **Unified Travel Hub:** A single dashboard to manage all flights, hotel confirmations, car rentals, and event tickets, eliminating the need for multiple apps and emails.
  * **Context-Aware Recommendations:** Suggests hidden gems, local events, and restaurants that align with the user's profile and real-time location during the trip.
  * **Smart Budget Tracking:** Provides real-time cost analysis and forecasting to ensure the trip stays within budget, with alerts for potential overspending.
  * **Interactive Map-Based Planning:** Allows users to visualize their entire trip on a map, understand routes, and explore points of interest spatially.

-----

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

This project utilizes a modern tech stack, with a mandatory focus on IBM Cloud services.

  * **AI & Machine Learning:**
      * **IBM Granite:** For Natural Language Understanding (NLU), personalization, and generative AI capabilities.
      * **IBM Watsonx.ai:** The platform for building, training, and deploying the AI model.
  * **Cloud & Deployment:**
      * **IBM Cloud:** The core cloud platform for hosting services.
      * **IBM Code Engine:** For deploying the application as a scalable, serverless workload.
      * **Docker:** For containerizing the application for consistent development and deployment.
  * **Backend:**
      * **Python:** The primary language for AI and backend logic.
      * **FastAPI / Flask:** High-performance web framework for building the API.
  * **Frontend:**
      * **React / Next.js:** For building a modern, responsive user interface.
      * **TypeScript:** For type-safe frontend development.
  * **Database:**
      * **PostgreSQL:** For storing user data, preferences, and structured itinerary information.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application is designed with a microservices-inspired architecture for scalability and maintainability.

1.  **Frontend (React App):** The user interface that captures user input and displays the travel plans.
2.  **API Gateway (FastAPI):** A single entry point that routes requests to the appropriate backend services.
3.  **Backend Services (Python):**
      * **Auth Service:** Manages user authentication and profiles.
      * **Planning Service:** The core service that communicates with the IBM Granite model via `watsonx.ai` to generate and modify itineraries.
      * **Data Service:** Fetches real-time data from third-party APIs (flights, weather, hotels).
      * **Notification Service:** Sends alerts to users (e.g., via email or push notifications).
4.  **IBM Cloud:** All backend services are deployed on IBM Code Engine. The `watsonx.ai` platform provides the connection to the Granite foundational model.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

  * Git
  * Python 3.9+
  * Node.js v18+
  * Docker & Docker Compose (Recommended)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-travel-planner.git
    cd ai-travel-planner
    ```

2.  **Set up Backend:**

      * Create a `.env` file in the `/backend` directory and add your credentials:
        ```env
        IBM_API_KEY=your_ibm_cloud_api_key
        PROJECT_ID=your_watsonx_project_id
        DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
        ```
      * Install Python dependencies and run the server:
        ```sh
        cd backend
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```

3.  **Set up Frontend:**

      * Navigate to the frontend directory, install dependencies, and start the client:
        ```sh
        cd ../frontend
        npm install
        npm start
        ```

4.  **Run with Docker (Recommended):**

      * Ensure your `.env` file is set up in the `/backend` directory.
      * From the root project directory, run:
        ```sh
        docker-compose up --build
        ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage

Once the application is running:

1.  **Sign Up:** Create an account and set your initial travel preferences (e.g., budget level, travel style like "adventure" or "relaxation").
2.  **Start Planning:** Enter a destination, desired dates, and a brief description of your ideal trip (e.g., "A relaxing 5-day beach vacation in Goa with a focus on local food").
3.  **Interact & Refine:** The agent will generate a complete itinerary. You can then chat with the agent to refine it further ("Can you find a cheaper hotel?" or "Add a museum visit on Tuesday").
4.  **Manage:** All your bookings and plans are accessible from your central dashboard.
